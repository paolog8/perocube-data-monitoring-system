-- MPP data access helpers.
-- Two objects bridge the gap between the hardware-centric schema and the
-- cell-centric view that scientists work with.
--
-- mpp_measurement_flat  : simple view — denormalizes tracker/slot names onto
--                         measurements for slot-level queries.
-- mpp_measurements_for_cell : table-returning function — returns all measurements
--                         attributed to a named solar cell, correctly scoped to
--                         the time intervals when that cell was connected.

-- Layer 2: cell-attributed measurements
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Interval derivation (LEAD approach):
--   All events for the cell are ordered by occurred_at.  LEAD gives each
--   event the timestamp of the *next* event for that cell.  After filtering
--   to connection events only:
--     interval_end = next event's occurred_at   (normally a disconnection)
--                  = NOW()                       (cell still connected — LEAD is NULL)
--   This correctly handles cells that move between slots: the interval for the
--   first connection ends precisely when the second connection begins.
